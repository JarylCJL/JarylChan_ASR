To track model drift, we can set up a monitoring pipeline that compares the statistical properties of the modelâ€™s input data over time. This can be done using scripting to set up a script to periodically assess the model performance over time after it has been deployed. Using statistical data, we can track if the performance of the model is deteriorating over time, which could indicate model drifting.
